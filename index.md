### Personal Inf
I was born in Jiangxi Province, where I spend my whore time living and studying there. In 2018, I graduated form NingDu Middle School of Jiangxi and got into my college now. In the college, I obtained not only the fundamental knowledge of my specialty, but also many friends in life. Generally speaking, I am a studious student, especially when doing the thing I am interested in, I will try my best to finish it no matter how difficult it is. When I was a sophomore, I thought that English would be significant to my further study, so I learned it very hard. I am a person with great perseverance, because I always think that the achievements the Great men attain are from their diligence and perseverance.
